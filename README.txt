If you want to use this Theme put the "Shell" Folder into the Vanilla Boards "theme" subfolder and apply it via the Dashboard. Do NOT
use the "design" folder from the root directory of this git repo, you will just add unneccessary resource images to you server. You can however just clone the repo if you want to play with the additional .svg Files you find here :)

This Theme is just version 0.2 so it's obviously not quite done. Suggestions welcome.
